# mp2

we use clang tidy for formatting

```
main.cpp -> drives logic, entrypoint

gamestate.cpp -> keeps track of move history and board state

matrix.cpp -> matrix helper class


logic
  track.cpp -> send data to cloud
  baseline.cpp -> simple minimax baseline
```

next steps:

- implement batch normalization/kernel regularization
- implement residual layer
- optimize speed
